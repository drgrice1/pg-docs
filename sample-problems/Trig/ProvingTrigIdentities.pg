BEGIN_PGML
This problem has three parts.  A part may be open if it is correct or if it is
the first incorrect part.  Clicking on the heading for a part toggles whether it
is displayed.

Section::Begin('Part 1');
BEGIN_PGML
In this multi-part problem, we will use algebra to verify the identity

>>[`\displaystyle \frac{\sin(t)}{1 - \cos(t)} = \frac{1 + \cos(t)}{\sin(t)}.`]<<

First, using algebra we may rewrite the equation above as
[`\displaystyle \sin(t) = \left( \frac{1 + \cos(t)}{\sin(t)} \right) \cdot \Big(`] [_]{'1 - cos(t)'}{15} [` \Big) `].
END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin('Part 2');
BEGIN_PGML
Using algebra we may rewrite the equation as
[`\sin(t) \cdot \big(`] [_]{'sin(t)'}{15} [`\big) = \big(1 + \cos(t)\big) \cdot \big(1 - \cos(t)\big)`].
END_PGML
Section::End();

Section::Begin('Part 3');
BEGIN_PGML
Finally, using algebra we may rewrite the equation as
[`\sin^2(t) =`] [_]{'1-(cos(t))^2'}{15}, which is true since
[`\cos^2(t) + \sin^2(t) = 1`]. Thus, the original identity can be derived by
reversing these steps.

COMMENT(
    'This is a multi-part problem
in which the next part is revealed only after the previous
part is correct.  Prevents students from entering trivial
identities (entering what they were given).  Uses PGML.'
