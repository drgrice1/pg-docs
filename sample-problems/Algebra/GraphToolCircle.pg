BEGIN_PGML
Graph the circle given by the following equation.

    [`[$circle_eq_lhs] = [$r ** 2]`]

[_]{$gt}
END_PGML

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
The equation of the circle of the form:

    [`[$circle_eq_lhs] = [$r ** 2]`]

has a center at [`([$h],[$k])`] and radius [$r].  To enter the graph, click the
circle tool, then click the center at [`([$h],[$k])`] and then click a second
point that is [$r] units from the center.  This is easist going left, right, up
or down from the center.

The solution is
