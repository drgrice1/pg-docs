On the graph below, plot the line [`[$line] = [$x0*$y0]`]

BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Two points are needed off this line.  It could be put in slope-intercept form
which would give a [`y`]-intercept and then a second point could be determined
from the slope.

Alternatively, the intercept form on the line is found by dividing the equation
by the right hand side to
[```\frac{x}{[$x0]}+ \frac{y}{[$y0]}=1```]
and thus the [`x`]-intercept is number in the fraction under the [`x`] or
 [$x0] and the [`y`]-intercept is the number in the fraction under the [`y`]
 or [$y0].  The solution is
