<pre><code>        ChoiceList.pm  -- super-class for all ChoiceList structures</code></pre>

<a href="#_podtop_"><h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1></a>

<p>ChoiceList.pm is not intended to be used as a stand alone object.</p>

<p>It is a super-class designed to be inherited by sub-classes that, through small changes, can be used for a variety of different questions that involve some sort of list of questions and/or answers.</p>

<p>ChoiceList.pm has been used to construct Match.pm, Select.pm, and Multiple.pm.</p>

<p>These three classes are objects that can be used to create the following question types:</p>

<p><b>Matching list:</b> Given a list of questions and answers, match the correct answers to the questions. Some answers may be used more than once and some may not be used at all. The order of the answers is usually random but some answers can be appended to the end in a set order (i.e. &#39;None of the above&#39;). Answers are given corresponding letters as shortcuts to typing in the full answer. (i.e. the answer to #1 is A).</p>

<p><b>Select list:</b> Given a list of questions and (usually) implied answers, give the correct answer to each question. This is intended mainly for true/false questions or other types of questions where the answers are short and can therefore be typed in by the user easily. If a select list is desired but the answers are too long to really type in, a popup-list of the answers can be used.</p>

<p><b>Multiple choice:</b> Given a single question and a list of answers, select the single correct answer. This structure creates a standard multiple choice question as would be seen on a standardize test. Extra answers are entered along with the question in a simple format and (as with Match.pm), if necessary, can be appended in order at the end (i.e. &#39;None of the above&#39;)</p>
