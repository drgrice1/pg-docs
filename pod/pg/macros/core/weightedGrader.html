<pre><code>  A weighted grader that allows you to assign arbitrary percentages
  to the various answers in a problem.  It also allows you to indicate
  that answering one part correctly will give you credit for some
  other part(s).  This way, if there are several parts leading up to
  a &quot;goal&quot; answer, and the student produces the goal answer by
  some other means, he can be given full credit for the problem anyway.


  WEIGHTED ANSWERS:

  Each problem is assigned a weight (the default is 1).  The
  student&#39;s score is then the sum of the weights for his correct
  answers divided by the total of the weights for all answers.  (To
  assign weights as percentages, use integers that add up to 100, eg,
  use 40 and 60 for the weights for two answers.)

  There are two ways to assign weights.  The first is to use the
  WEIGHTED_ANS() routine (in place of ANS) to give an answer checker
  plus a weight.

  Example:

      WEIGHTED_ANS(std_num_cmp($ans1),2);

  This assigns a weight of 2 to the corresponding numeric answer.

  As with ANS(), WEIGHTED_ANS() can take more than one answer checker and
  weight.

  Example:

      WEIGHTED_ANS(
         std_num_cmp($ans1), 40,
         std_num_cmp($ans2), 60
      );

  This assigns 40% to the first answer and 60% to the second answer.

  The second way of assigning a weight is through the weight_ans()
  function.  This takes a single answer checker and weight and returns
  a new answer checker of the same type that has the desired weight.
  Thus

      ANS(weight_ans(std_num_cmp($ans1),2));

  is equivalent to the first example above.

  The main purpose for weighted_ans() is so that weights can be used
  with UNORDERED_ANS(), or in other places where you want to use the
  weighted answer checker directly.  For example:

     UNORDERED_ANS(
        weight_ans(std_num_cmp($ans1),40),
        weight_ans(std_num_cmp($ans2),60),
     );
  
  produces two answers whose order doesn&#39;t matter, but the student
  will get 40% for getting $ans1 and 60% for getting $ans2 (no matter
  what order they appear in).

  Note that the blank_cmp() answer checker has a weight of 0 by
  default.  You can override this using weight_ans(); for example,
  weight_ans(blank_cmp(),1) makes the blank count the same as all
  the other answers.  (If there are two or more non-blank answers,
  then having the blanks with weight 0 will allow the observant
  student to deduce the number of blank answers from the percentage
  for a single correct answer, provided all the non-blank answers are
  equally weighted).

  Once you have given weights to the answers, you also need to
  install the weighted grader.  Do this using the command

      install_weighted_grader();


  HAVING ONE ANSWER PROVIDE CREDIT FOR ANOTHER:

  You may want to have a correct answer for one problem automatically
  give credit for one or more other parts of the problem.  For example
  If several parts are used to lead up to the &quot;real&quot; answer to the
  problem, and the student produces that final answer without doing
  the intermediate parts (perhaps using some other method), then you
  may want to give the student full credit for the problem anyway.
  You can do so in the following way.

  First, let us call the final answer the &quot;goal&quot; answer, and the
  answer that it would give automatic credit for the &quot;optional&quot; answer.

  The optional answer blank must be a named answer, e.g.,

    BEGIN_TEXT
      You get credit for this answer: \{NAMED_ANS_RULE(&#39;optional&#39;,10)\}
      When you answer this one: \{ans_rule(10)\}
    END_TEXT
    NAMED_ANS(&#39;optional&#39;,std_num_cmp(5));

  Then for the goal answer, in place of ANS, use CREDIT_ANS, listing the
  optional answer as the second argument:

    CREDIT_ANS(std_num_cmp(10),&#39;optional&#39;);

  You could also use NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS for the optional answer, and
  supply a third argument for CREDIT_ANS, which is the weight for the
  goal answer.  For example:

    NAMED_WEIGHTED_ANS(&#39;optional&#39;,std_num_cmp(5),20);
    CREDIT_ANS(std_num_cmp(10),&#39;optional&#39;,80);

  This way, if the student gets the optional part right (but not the
  goal), he gets 20%, and if he gets the goal right, he gets 100%.

  One can use CREDIT_ANS to give credit for several other (named)
  answers at once by passing a list of names rather than a single one,
  as in:

    CREDIT_ANS(std_num_cmp(10),[&#39;optional1&#39;,&#39;optional2&#39;],80);

  The weight_ans() routine, described in the section above, also can
  be used to give credit to another answer.  In addition to the
  answer-checker and the weight, you can pass an answer name (or
  list of names) that should get credit when this one is right.
  For example

    ANS(weight_ans(std_num_cmp(10),80,&#39;optional&#39;));

  is equivalent to 
 
    CREDIT_ANS(std_num_cmp(10),&#39;optional&#39;,80);

  One caveat to keep in mind is that credit is given to the optional
  answer ONLY if the answer is left blank (or is actually correct).
  Credit will NOT be given if the answer is incorrect, even if the
  goal answer IS correct.

  When credit IS given, the blank answer is still marked as incorrect
  in the grey answer report at the top of the page, but the student
  gets awarded the points for that answer anyway (with no other
  indication).  It is possible to cause the blank to be marked as
  correct, but this seemed confusing to the students.

  Once you have issued the various ANS calls, you also need to
  install the weighted grader.  Do this using the command

      install_weighted_grader();</code></pre>
